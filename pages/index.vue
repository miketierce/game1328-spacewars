            <p classs="body-2">
              Everybody wants the best tech but few are willing to put in the
              work for it.
              The Asteroid Mine is by far the best place to mine the ore you
              need to upgrade or
              purchase new equipment.
              <br /> <br />
              Click on cells in the Asteroid Mine to check for ore. You can
              process the ore into
              new items and equipment from your Inventory View.
